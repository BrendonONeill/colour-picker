# Hyu-Sync

This is a colour picker application is a mix of picked features I used in different sites, and created a place to pick colours for projects and also check their contrast to each other to meet the WCAG requirements.

## Working on
- Improving the maths to makes sure to get the right values from the colours.
- Adding more shades like Triad, Square and Monochromatic.
- User input to convert Hex to RGBA and HSL.
- Improving performance of application

## Known Errors
- Colours selected sometimes the Hex numbers are a little bit off from what is displayed.
- Screens under 380px width UI shifts out of containers.
